    wind, I swear. This place has the strangest vibes. there are signs of people
    living here but no one\u2019s about. I wish there was someone I could ask questions,
    to see if the rumours are true. but perhaps it\u2019s a good sign that no one
    is around. Maybe there is nothing really happening here and it's all a big hoax.
    Still, it has the locals shook even got the police to look into it they always
    came up empty though, worth checking out to be sure. \n\n\n"
